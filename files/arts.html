      <h1>Art & Music</h1>
      <p>WUNS believes in the power of creativity to foster imagination and social skills in our students. 
        We make sure that each student gets to grow and explore using the power of art. Together with our 
        superb faculty, we bring the best out of your child!</p>

      <h3>Art with Miss Suzy</h3>
      <p>
        <a class="download" href="downloads/WUNS-announcement-ART.pdf" target="_blank">Letter from Ms. Suzy about WUNS
          Art Enrichment for School Year
          2019-2020</a><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
        Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
        each month and build understanding through conversations and
        experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
        home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
        of Art. I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
        since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
        the Visual Arts with the children!
      </p>
      <h3>Music with Ms. Christina</h3>
      <p>
        I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
        year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
        taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
        teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
        variety of ensembles. 

        Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
        songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
        children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
        classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
        voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
        instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
        create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
        tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
        fun!
