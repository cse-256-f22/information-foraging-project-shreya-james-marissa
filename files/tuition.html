      <h1>Philosophy & Policies</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>
        At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	every	child	is	a	unique	individual	
        with	his	or	her	own pattern	and	timetable	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual	and	physical	
        growth.
        <br />
        We	believe	in	learning	through	play;	we	provide	fun,	child-centered	activities	that	effectively	
        engage	students.	We	encourage	creativity	in	all	areas	with	a	special	focus	on	the	arts	to	
        enhance	language	and	thinking.	Above	all,	our	goals	are	that	children	will	develop	a	genuine	
        pleasure	in	learning,	that	they	develop	confidence	in	their	ability	to	learn	and	to	accomplish	
        challenging	tasks	and	that	they	gain	experience	and	skills	in	interacting	with	others.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
        catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
        provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
        developmental	areas.
        <br />
        The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.

      <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleButton(this.id)">Discipline</button>
        <div class="content">
            <br />
          <p>The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.
          The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.
          Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li>
            <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</li>
            <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings.</li>
            <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
            <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
          </ul>
         <p> When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community services if parents so desire.
        </p>

        <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleButton(this.id)">School Day Policies and Procedures </button>
        <div class="content">
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Orientation Day</h3>
          <p>This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect during the school year.</p>
          <p>The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.</p>
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Parking</h3>
          <p>Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3 parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special school events.
          </p>
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Drop-Off and Pick-Up</h3>
          <p>All traffic for arrival and dismissal must proceed from the parking lot entrance west of the school, driving east and stopping at the school entrance. Drivers stay in their cars and teachers help the children enter and exit. Teachers are outside for arrival of children at 8:50 a.m. for the morning session and 12:30 p.m. for the afternoon session. At no time should your child be allowed to exit your car without a teacher present. If you arrive late, you must escort your child to the classroom. At dismissal (11:45 a.m. and 3:15 p.m.) children assemble outside the front door on benches or, in inclement weather, inside the front door. The teachers bring children to their cars. No child can be dismissed to anyone other than persons designated (in writing) by the parents. Your child must hold hands with a teacher or parent when in front of the school in the drop-off/pick-up area.
          </p>
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Clothing</h3>
          <p>It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are comfortable, washable, and suitable for activities both indoors and outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of clothing appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should be aware of weather conditions and dress children accordingly, as outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. During the winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will usually go outside when it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified.</p>
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Snacks</h3>
          <p>The nursery school provides a healthy snack each day for the children. Fresh fruit (apples, oranges, pears, bananas, melons, etc.) are purchased each week and kept in the “children’s refrigerator.” There are a wide variety of crackers (soda, graham, Ritz, Goldfish, etc.) available. Snack time consists of a fruit, crackers and water. The older children learn to pour their own water.
          </p>
          <h3 id="collape_h2">Birthday Celebrations</h3>
          <p>We celebrate each child’s birthday (or half-birthday for children with summer dates). If desired, talk with your child’s teacher about bringing a special snack to share with the class.
          </p>
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Holidays</h3>
          <p>We are fortunate to have diverse cultures and religious beliefs in our nursery school community. Our policy is to celebrate family traditions, not the religious aspects, of holidays.</p>
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Field Trips</h3>
          <p>Teachers frequently plan short walking trips on campus. Occasionally, trips are planned off- campus to further enhance the children’s experiences. Each time an off-campus trip is planned, parents will be notified in advance and required to sign a form granting permission for the child’s participation.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleButton(this.id)">Parent-School Communication </button>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Confidentiality Statement</h2>
            <p>The records kept on families enrolled at the nursery school are confidential. Staff may not share information on file with others without written permission from a parent or guardian. Information received while in the performance of duties, either written or verbal, shall also be considered confidential and shall be treated the same as written information contained in the child’s file.
            </p>
            <p>The nursery school adheres to the Code of Ethics created by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). This document provides guidelines for responsible behavior and establishes a common ground for early childhood professionals to resolve ethical and moral issues encountered in daily practice. The foundation for the Code of Ethics is a commitment to quality early childhood practices, including providers’ goals to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Appreciate childhood as a unique, valuable part of the human life.</li>
                <li>Base program practices on knowledge of child development.</li>
                <li>Appreciate and support the child/family bond.</li>
                <li>Understand children in the context of their family, culture and society.</li>
                <li>Respect the uniqueness and worth of children, family members and colleagues.</li>
                <li>Develop helpful relationships based on trust, respect and positive regard.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Parent Staff Commmunication</h2>
            <p>Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.</p>
            <h2> Asseesment and Parent-Teacher Confrences</h2>
            <p>Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children.
            The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
            </p>
            <h3 id="collape_h2">Referral Process for Children with Special Needs</h3>
            <p>It is the policy at the nursery school that after school is underway and teachers have had time to observe children in the classroom, a teacher who feels help is needed in understanding the behavior of a child in the classroom will ask the director to come and observe. After reviewing our observations, we schedule an appointment with the parents to discuss the school behavior. In the course of that meeting, we may request that a community professional evaluate the child in the classroom. This observation may result in a request for further evaluation. If needed, community facilities that better serve the child’s needs may be recommended to the parents.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleButton(this.id)">Health Policies</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Health Policy</h2>
                <p>The nursery school makes a great effort to provide a healthy environment for your children. We work diligently on forming healthy habits such as washing hands before eating or handling food, and after toileting. Our dishes and cups are put through a dishwasher/ sanitizer to sterilize them and to prevent the spread of germs. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned daily and checked for safety. However, despite everyone’s best efforts, children and adults will get sick. It is an expected part of life. If children become ill at school, they will be cared for in the office until a parent can pick them up.</p>
                <p>Parents are requested to keep their child home in the event of the diseases or symptoms noted below. The child will be allowed to return to school when he or she has been free of these symptoms and has not required medication for a minimum of 24 hours. If a symptom persists (such as rash or cough), or if a communicable disease is confirmed (measles, chicken pox, etc.), returning to school may require a statement from the child’s physician declaring that the condition is no longer contagious.</p>
                <p>PLEASE CALL the nursery school to inform us that your child is sick, especially if he/ she has a communicable disease. Communicable diseases or conditions include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Strep Throat</li>
                  <li>Mumps</li>
                  <li>Hepatitis A</li>
                  <li>Scabies</li>
                  <li>Chicken Pox</li>
                  <li>Impetigo</li>
                  <li>Diarrheal Diseases</li>
                  <li>Pinworm</li>
                  <li>Measels</li>
                  <li>Conjunctivitus</li>
                  <li>Lice</li>
                  <li>Ringworm</li>
                  <li>Other viral or bacterial infections</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Also, the following symptoms could indicate a contagious disease:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fever</li>
                  <li>Diarrhea</li>
                  <li>Vomiting</li>
                  <li>Skin eruptions/rash</li>
                  <li>Runny nose</li>
                  <li>Lethargy</li>
                  <li>Sore throat</li>
                  <li>Reddened weeping eyes</li>
                   <li>Constant sneezing</li>
                   <li>Productive cough</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If your child is exposed to or contracts a communicable disease, it is essential that you call the nursery school to tell us. In turn, we will send a letter home to inform parents that your child has been exposed to a communicable disease.
                  </p>
            <h2>Medication</h2>
            <p>The nursery school encourages parents to administer medications at home and not at school. The nursery school staff does not routinely administer medications to the children. Also, we do not apply sunscreen or insect repellent. Medication that absolutely needs to be administered during school hours must be cleared with the director.</p>
            <h2>Allergies</h2>
            <p>If your child has a known allergic reaction, this must be documented on the child’s History and Health Record kept in his/ her file in the office. Also, please report these allergies to the classroom teachers. For your child’s safety, these allergies will be posted in your child’s classroom. If you object to this information being posted, please contact the director. In case of severe allergies such as to bee stings or nuts, an EpiPen Injector Kit may be kept at the nursery school and used by the director and/or teachers who are trained in its administration. This is stored in the emergency backpack in the child’s classroom. Each classroom has a First Aid Kit that includes the EpiPen (if required). This, along with emergency medical forms for every child, accompanies the classes on all walking or driving field trips.
            </p>
            <h2>Peanut and Tree Policy</h2>
            <p>A growing number of children deal with food allergies and, specifically, potentially life- threatening peanut and tree nut allergies. Washington University Nursery School will be a peanut- and tree nut-free (Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts) preschool beginning with the 2017-2018 school year. The full explanation of the Peanut and Tree Nut Policy describes how teachers and families will support the efforts of safeguarding the health and safety of the children.</p>
            <h2>Accidents</h2>
            <p>The nursery school makes every effort to ensure the safety of all children. However, should a serious accident occur, a parent is immediately contacted. If parents and emergency contacts cannot be reached, we will take your child to the hospital designated on your enrollment form. Minor injuries will be reported to you by your child’s teacher at pick-up. All injuries will also be reported in written form and given to you at pickup time. We will ask you to sign an identical form to be placed in your child’s file at school.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleButton(this.id)">Emergency Procedures </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We have effective, campus-supported policies at the Nursery School to keep your children safe. Below you will find our Emergency Procedures. We have a safety drill each month, and all staff is informed of procedures, locations of first aid kits and emergency medications, and emergency meeting locations.</p>
          <h3 id="collapse_h2">Parent Notification Proceedure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Parents will be notified of campus emergencies and evacuations through the WUSTL Mobile app, which is the fastest and easiest way for anyone — with or without a Washington University email address — to receive emergency alerts. The app is available for iOS or Android. Note that it is important that you enable push notifications to receive alerts.</li>
            <li>The school has an emergency preparedness bag easily accessible with all contact information, allergy information, and other necessities.</li>
            <li>WUNS staff will attempt to send out an emergency email/text explaining the situation as much as possible, as a follow up to the all-campus emergency alert.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>In case of FIRE:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Short bell rings alert you to a fire or drill.</li>
            <li>Close doors and evacuate in a calm manner through the nearest exit, as designated on our evacuation map.</li>
            <li>Stay in the designated outdoor area until cleared to reenter.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>In case of SEVERE WEATHER:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>One long continuous bell ring alerts you to severe weather, i.e. tornado threat.</li>
            <li>Take shelter under tables or in a hallway or bathroom.</li>
            <li>Assume tornado position when threat is imminent.</li>
            <li>Stay in the designated area until cleared to reenter classrooms.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>In case of LOCKDOWN:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>If the WU Emergency Alert System is activated and announces, “Go to   secure area” a whistle will be blown.</li>
            <li>Children will be moved out of sight to the designated safe area in the school.</li>
            <li>Teachers will have cell phones to get emergency information from the WU Emergency headquarters to follow accordingly.</li>
            <li>No one will be permitted to enter or leave the building unless evacuation is necessary.</li>
            <li>If possible, an emergency email/text will be sent out explaining the circumstance.</li>
            <li>Lockdown will continue until the school receives an “all clear” signal from WU emergency personnel.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Inclement Weather</h2>
          <p>The nursery school, as a department within Washington University, follows the university policy for school closings as a result of inclement weather. It is university policy that faculty and staff members should report to work and leave work at their regularly scheduled times. Should weather conditions create potentially hazardous travel, the vice chancellor for human resources will evaluate the severity of the situation and, in consultation with the executive vice chancellors, determine the appropriate measures to be taken. Factors to be considered will include the safety of our faculty, staff and students as well as the services that must be provided despite the severe weather. In the event that the decision is made to dismiss employees early, the staff of the Office of Human Resources will contact the various executive vice chancellors, vice chancellors and deans, who, in turn, will be responsible for communicating this decision to faculty and staff members. A nursery school staff member would then relay that decision to the parent community via phone and/or email.

        <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleButton(this.id)">Special Programs </button>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>School Picnic</h2>
          <p>Families are invited to a school gathering at the beginning and end of the school year. “Popsicles at the Park” is held the week prior to school starting. This fun family event at Shaw Park allows children and parents to get acquainted with new classmates and their teachers. The last week of school families gather for a dinner/potluck at Shaw Park to celebrate the culmination of the year.</p>
          <h2>Open House</h2>
          <p>In October, WUNS holds an “open house” for current children and their families. This event allows parents and siblings to visit the child’s classroom, meet the teachers and play on the playground. Children are excited to “show-off” their school to their family.</p>
          <h2>After-school Playdates</h2>
          <p>We arrange times throughout the year to have the WUNS playground open after school from 3:15-5:00 p.m. so children and their families can play. Siblings are welcome to join. All children must have a parent or caregiver present to attend.
          </p>
          <h2>Halloween Parade</h2>
          <p>Parents are invited to our annual Halloween parade followed by songs and snack in their child’s classroom. An invitation and details will be shared with all parents.</p>
          <h2>Donuts with Dads and Muffins with Moms</h2>
          <p>Parents are invited to enjoy time to play in the classroom and a special snack with their preschoolers during these special days (fall and spring). Children will bring home invitations and details about each event.
          </p>
          <h2>Dine Out Nights</h2>
          <p>The Nursery School partners with local restaurants to provide social gatherings for families. On these Dine Out Nights, families and friends are encouraged to eat out at the designated restaurant. Families enjoy having a meal with fellow WUNS classmates and parents, while also supporting the Nursery School.</p>
          <h2>Night at the Magic House</h2>
          <p>In February, the Nursery School rents the early childhood section of the Magic House for Nursery School families. This special night is a huge hit with everyone. Parents can enjoy a private night at their child’s favorite hands-on museum!</p>
          <h2>Annual Parent Social</h2>
          <p>In early spring, parents are invited to a “parent-only” social event. In the past it has been a trivia night, gallery night (highlighting preschooler’s artwork), and/or silent auction. Monies raised help support our enrichment programs – Art, Spanish, Nature and Music, as well as specific equipment or school needs.</p>
