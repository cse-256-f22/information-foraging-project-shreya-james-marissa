      <h1>Philosophy </h1>
      <br />
      <h2>
        At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	every	child	is	a	unique	individual	
        with	his	or	her	own pattern	and	timetable	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual	and	physical	
        growth.
        <br />
        We	believe	in	learning	through	play;	we	provide	fun,	child-centered	activities	that	effectively	
        engage	students.	We	encourage	creativity	in	all	areas	with	a	special	focus	on	the	arts	to	
        enhance	language	and	thinking.	Above	all,	our	goals	are	that	children	will	develop	a	genuine	
        pleasure	in	learning,	that	they	develop	confidence	in	their	ability	to	learn	and	to	accomplish	
        challenging	tasks	and	that	they	gain	experience	and	skills	in	interacting	with	others.
      </h2>
      <p>Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
        catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
        provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
        developmental	areas.
        <br />
        The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.</p>

              <p>The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.
              The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.
              Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through:
              <ul>
                  <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
                  <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li>
                  <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</li>
                  <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings.</li>
                  <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
                  <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
              </ul>
              When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community services if parents so desire.
